Our communications happen only via our official emails (look for @hodpub.com in the address) or through messages sent by CussaMitre (@CussaMitre on Telegram/Discord).

At Hod Publishing, we specialize in high-fidelity conversions of books into Foundry VTT modules and systems. By high fidelity, we mean replicating the original style, layout, fonts, and colors of your books to ensure players feel like they’re using the PDF while benefiting from all the interactivity and enhancements Foundry offers.

We’ve had the privilege of collaborating with amazing publishers and creators, including Free League, Ginny Di, JVC Parry, Metis Creative (Historica Arcanum), Mr. Tarrasque, Absolute Tabletop, The Wanderer’s Tome, Big Empty Blue/Quill's Quests, Melsonian Arts Council, and others.
